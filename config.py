#This is the image capture bit_rate. Defaut value for me is 2M.
bit_rate='2M'

#This is the max size of one display dimension of a device. The other is set accordingly to preserve aspect ratio. I set default value to 700.

#These are the cv2 configurations required for the hough algorithm that finds circles.
#You can play with these parameters and tune them if you like. If you achieve better perfomance send me a mail please.

#Monitor and function configuration
#Here you can set the monitor values, in order to capture a piece of your monitor (The place where you put your phone's screen)
#I didn't find a way to just capture a standard window and get rid of these but maybe someone else can.
#By default, you will find the values I used for my Xiaomi MI A2 lite.

top=55
left=1065
width=300
height=640

#The last value is used for the sleep function.
#It sets the time that the program needs to wait in order to avoid the smartphone screen being locked and rejecting all input.
#The click height negate variable, stores the pixel under which you can click anything.
#This is to avoid clicking circles found on the timer or the points collected and losing time.

timesleep=0.08
click_height_negate=78

#For me 0.08 seemed to work best, but this depends on your processor and battery amount, so be sure to not have very low battery when using the script!
