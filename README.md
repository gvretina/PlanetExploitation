# PlanetExploitation
A small planet exploitation script to have some fun

### Configuration
**Please read and configure config.py**.

I have set my own default settings but they probably won't work
with your monitor and phone, as display size needs to be set.
You can also try and configure hough parameters and functionality through this file.
I plan to post a video on how to use setup correctly. You only need to fix config.py once
anyway.

### Default Options
If you want to just give it a try with defaults:

```
./main.py --setup
```

After setting up with the help of script output run

```
./main.py --run
```

**But with caution!**
Run it only when your phone is on the screen "Tap to start level" as shown by Tap_to_Start_level.jpg!

### Compatibility
Version is currently linux only but I plan to fix it for windows as well.
Along with the requirements.txt you will also need scrcpy to run this script
